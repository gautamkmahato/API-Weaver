            the training dataset.
          example: 10000
        learning_rate:
          default: 0.0001

          title: Weight Decay
          description: >-
            (Advanced Usage) Weight decay adds a term to the loss function that
            is proportional to the sum of the squared weights. This term reduces
            the magnitude of the weights and prevents them from growing too
            large.

          title: Warmup Fraction
          description: >-
            (Advanced Usage) A parameter that specifies the percentage of the
            total training steps at which the learning rate warm-up phase ends.
            During this phase, the learning rate gradually increases from a
            small value to the initial learning rate, helping to stabilize the
            training process and improve convergence.
